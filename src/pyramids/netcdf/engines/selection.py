"""Spatial / dimensional selection engine for :class:`pyramids.netcdf.NetCDF`.

Owns the crop / sel / subset / reduce family extracted from the
``netcdf.py`` god-object (issue #615, STR-1). Per the agreed design the
NetCDF-specific cropping (``crop`` and its curvilinear path) is folded in
here rather than living in a separate spatial engine.

The public ``NetCDF`` methods are thin façades delegating to this engine;
signatures, behaviour, and return types are unchanged. Cropping reaches
the container's own plumbing through the weakref-proxied back-reference
``self._ds`` — including ``self._ds.spatial.crop`` for the base affine
crop (equivalent to the ``super().crop`` call the override used) and the
shared helpers ``_apply_to_all_variables`` / ``_preserve_netcdf_metadata``
/ ``_bbox_geotransform`` which stay on ``NetCDF`` because the not-yet-moved
methods still use them.

        On a **root MDIM container** this crops every variable and
        returns a new in-memory NetCDF container with the cropped
        results. On a **variable subset** it delegates to the parent
        :meth:`pyramids.dataset.Dataset.crop` and re-wraps the result
        as :class:`NetCDF` to preserve variable metadata
        (``_band_dim_name``, ``_band_dim_values``, :meth:`sel`).

        Args:
            mask: GeoDataFrame with polygon geometry, or a Dataset
                to use as a spatial mask. Mutually exclusive with
                ``bbox``; exactly one of the two must be supplied.
            touch: If True, include cells that touch the mask
                boundary. Defaults to True.
            bbox (keyword-only): ``(west, south, east, north)``
                quadruple in the CRS named by ``epsg``. Internally
                wrapped in a one-row :class:`FeatureCollection` via
                :meth:`FeatureCollection.from_bbox` and routed through
                the same polygon path. The FC is built **once** so a
                root-container crop does not rebuild it for every
                variable. Mutually exclusive with ``mask``.
            epsg (keyword-only): CRS for ``bbox`` — anything geopandas
                accepts for ``crs=`` (EPSG int, ``"EPSG:4326"``, WKT,
                :class:`pyproj.CRS`). Defaults to the dataset's own
                CRS, so a bbox in the dataset's native CRS needs no
                extra argument; pass it explicitly for a bbox in a
                different CRS (the standard reprojection path handles
                it).
            chunks (keyword-only): Lazy-read chunking for the
                **curvilinear** crop path only — forwarded to
                :meth:`read_array` so the cropped window is read through
                the dask-backed lazy path (``"auto"`` or a ``{"rows":
                ..., "cols": ...}`` dict). The curvilinear crop reads only
                the polygon's bounding window regardless; ``chunks`` makes
                that windowed read lazy/chunked. It is a per-variable,
                curvilinear-only option: it raises ``ValueError`` if given
                for a rectilinear (affine-warp) crop (which is eager), or
                on a **root container** (call crop on a single variable via
                :meth:`get_variable` instead).

        Returns:
            NetCDF: Cropped container or variable subset.

        Raises:
            ValueError: Both ``mask`` and ``bbox`` were supplied, or
                ``chunks`` was given on a root container or a rectilinear
                crop.
            TypeError: Neither ``mask`` nor ``bbox`` was supplied.

        Examples:
            - Crop every variable of a root NetCDF container by a
              bbox in the dataset's own CRS (`epsg` is inferred). The
              noah fixture's geotransform is ``cell_size=0.5°``,
              ``origin=(0, 90)``, 512×512 cells — so its coordinate
              range is ``x ∈ [0, 256)`` and ``y ∈ (-166, 90]``. The
              bbox below sits well inside that range:
                ```python
                >>> from pyramids.netcdf import NetCDF
                >>> nc = NetCDF.read_file(
                ...     "tests/data/netcdf/noah-precipitation-1979.nc"

                >>> cropped = nc.crop(bbox=(10.0, -50.0, 50.0, -20.0))
                >>> sorted(cropped.variables) == sorted(nc.variables)
                True

                ```
            - Mutual-exclusion guard:
                ```python
                >>> from pyramids.feature import FeatureCollection
                >>> from pyramids.netcdf import NetCDF
                >>> nc = NetCDF.read_file(
                ...     "tests/data/netcdf/noah-precipitation-1979.nc"
                ... )
                >>> fc = FeatureCollection.from_bbox(
                ...     (10.0, -50.0, 50.0, -20.0), epsg=nc.epsg,
                ... )
                >>> try:
